Pass Manager Demo for PyFlow

This example demonstrates how to use PyFlow's new LLVM-inspired pass manager system
for flexible composition and execution of analysis and optimization passes.

The pass manager provides:
- Pass registration with dependencies
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Caching and invalidation
- Pipeline construction and execution
- Standardized pass interfaces
